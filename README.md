# Android-Terminology

# Function
- is a segment of a program that performs a specific task (camelCase)
- define a function - name(verb or verb phrase), 
                    - parameters(inputs - piece of data a fun needs to perform), 
                    - body(instructions about how to perform a task) 
                    - fun name(inputs){body}

# Variable
- container for a piece of data - refer to it by name to access it's value (camelCase)
- you *define/declare* a variable to uniquely identify it.(what data to hold, data type, provide an initial value(optional))
- declaration: val count: Int = 2. This statement creates an Int value that holds 2.
- when you use the variable you tell Kotlin compilet you want to use the variable's value.
- value is *initialized* to 2. This means that 2 is the first value stored in the variable when the variable is declared.
- var x = 10 // x was initialised to 10
- x = 20 // x has been reassigned to 20 (we assigned 20 to x)

- *Var* is mutable
- *Val*(read-only) keyword - when you expect the value not to change 
  -  cannot be reassigned, cannot edit or modify.

# Expression
- is a small unit of code that evaluates to a value. Expression can be made of variables, functions etc. 
-  count(expression) = 2(value). The expression evaluates to 2. Evaluates means determining the value of the expression.
